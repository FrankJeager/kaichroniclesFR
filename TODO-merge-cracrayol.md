    - Psi-surge loyalty bonus HERE. CHECK THIS
    - Change to ActionChart.isWeaponskillActive() > state.hasCompletedKaiMagnakaiSerie() I think is wrong. This will give you
      mastery with any weapon, but this is used for other things (see "weaponskillActive" rule). CHANGE THIS
    - This line in actionChart:
        ```
            } else if (state.book.isMagnakaiBook() || (state.hasCompletedKaiMagnakaiSerie() && (!this.disciplines.contains("wpnmstry") || !this.hasWeaponskillWith(currentWeapon.weaponType || currentWeapon.id)))) {
        ```
      is not clear for me (currentWeapon.weaponType || currentWeapon.id ???). CHANGE THIS
    - Related to previous: ActionChart.hasWeaponskillWith seems to be changed to accept a set of weapon types. Document this (CHECK THIS)

* TSLINT:
    - TSLint is deprecated...
    - Check if remains any "throw new Error("

* Error in setup:
    - Add breakpoint at Item.prototype.loadImageInfo start
    - Check the setup log. They appear "undefined OK" messages...

* Book 12 (Spanish):
    sect350: This book is different from previous. You have to click on a footer note link to continue to the next book...
    Ugly. Add a message rule to help?

* Book 13 tests:
    - Up to sect1
    - Remove showCount property from mechanics-13+
    - "Game rules section": There is a link to the "Readers’ Handbook": Read this!
    - Big TODO: Added "dropDisciplines" to "tssf" section. Needed because you don't carry previous Magnakai displiclines.
      But you should keep your "Lore circles" and other bonuses... So, we should keep a track of old previous book series
      disciplines.... Or, assume that if you have moved to a new serie from a previous one, you have all the old serie 
      disciplines

* Book 14+:
    - Add rule "restoreDeliveranceUse" on each book "tssf" section

* Spanish books erratas:
    - Book 13, sect equipmnt: "tu nueva Carta de Acciónde Gran Maestro" should be "tu nueva Carta de Acción de Gran Maestro" (space)
    - Book 13, sect1: 
        * '" Me gustaría poder"' should be "Me gustaría poder" (space)
        * 'en tu misión.”dice Rimoah' should be 'en tu misión,” dice Rimoah' (comma, and space)
