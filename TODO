- Books n >= 8: Max number of special objects is 12
- Check reported bugs on Google play:
  * Saved games removed when adding new games
  * Objects types
  * In book 5 there is a point where the Vordak is using mind to find you. Instructions say to roll and add 2 if you have 
    camouflage skill. It also says to add 3 if you have mind shield. I had both but the game only added 2 for my camouflage 
    skill and didn't take in to account mind shield.
  * Others?
- Erratas:
  * Book 5+ equimpnt: English ref to "safekeeping", Spanish hasn't
- Allow to export / import saved games to the SD card
- Add button to explain combat ratio

  * FAQ
- ERROR: Hunting STILL activated on book 3... 
  (maybe fixed: BookSectionStates.fromStateObject, added line "this.huntEnabled = stateObject.huntEnabled;" on v 1.6.3)
- Android application:
  * App lifeciclye
  * Load games page: Show info about saved games
  * Load games page: Remove ".json" extension
  * Save game: Do not be so restrictive with file names characters
  * Replace toastr by Android toasts ???
  * Remove animations from modal dialogs (only for Android, performance...)
- Save games is not working on Safari
- Toasts with images: align text when the text is multiline
- Combats should be sequential: First finish the first one, then the second, etc
- If the hunting is disabled on the current section, show it on some place (Action Chart?)
- Document all rules
- Common performance (Android and web):
  * Rendering performance on book 2 / sect equimpnt
- Test all books / all sections rendering. It should be valid HTML5
  (https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html)
- Test tags <ch.* /> replacements
- Find "TODO" and do it
- Shared images on multiples books:
  * Allow to declare images on multiple books
  * Choose the latest available image
- New game page: 
  * Do not show the license text on Android (the book was already downloaded)
  * Ask for the random table type
- Use latest version on PAON data on SVN (a fixed commit number)
- Allow to read the "Lore-circles of the Magnakai" section from the "Magnakai Disciplines" section (with a dialog?)
- If a object description is too long, do not show the entire description: Show the first characters, and add a link
  to display the entire description (see pouchadgana object, and sommerswerd?)
