- Add button to explain combat ratio
- Kai level "Tutelary" with "Weaponmastery": Tutelaries are able to use defensive combat skills to great effect 
  when fighting unarmed. When entering combat without a weapon, Tutelaries lose only 2 points from their COMBAT SKILL, instead of the usual 4 points.
- Kai level "Mentora" with "Weaponmastery": Mentoras skilled in Weaponmastery are more accurate when using all missile 
  weapons, whether fired (e.g. a bow) or thrown (e.g. a dagger). When using a bow or thrown weapon and instructed to pick a 
  number from the Random Number Table, add 2 to the number picked if you are a Mentora with the Magnakai Discipline 
  of Weaponmastery.

- Document all rules
- Common performance (Android and web):
  * Rendering performance on book 2 / sect equimpnt
