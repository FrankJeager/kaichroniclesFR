- Show a toast when you change the current weapon on the Action Chart
- Documentation for "onInventoryEvent" rule
- Object images on book 9+:
  1) After downloaded books 9-12 convert SVG object images to PNG into the book directory. This is needed because the books SVN don't contain
     ALL images (only some)
  2) Use the current book image
- Use latest version on PAON data on SVN (a fixed commit number)
- Better explanation about how to drop objects on the Kai monastery
- When you cancel a saved games import, it say "error", and it is not

  * Objects types
  * Others?
- Ask help to Alarion with english translations
- Bugs reported on Google Play:
  * Finally, finally there's a proper LW game book app. The only problem I've noticed is that it only gives Silver Bow's bonus in the 
    sections of book 6 that specifically mention it, and not at all 'rolls' as it is supposed to.
- Performance
- Quivers with no arrows available on section should not show "(0 arrows)". Show "(0 arrows)" only on Action chart. Same to sell quiver
  object (see book 8, sect139)
- ERRATAS:
  * Send patch!!!

  * 9, sect5: "CATALEJO", not in English version
  * 9, sect8: "Ahórrate LAS condolencias"
  * 9, sect11: Spanish / English differences about meals
  * 9, 14: "(If your source of light is a Torch, remember to erase it from your Action Chart.)" if not in Spanish (it's on sect 197)
  * 9, 82: "Agresión mental" should be "Acometida Psíquica"

  * https://github.com/tonib/kaichronicles/issues/5
  * https://www.projectaon.org/es/foro3/viewtopic.php?p=27752#p27752

  * FAQ
- ERROR: Hunting STILL activated on book 3... 
  (maybe fixed: BookSectionStates.fromStateObject, added line "this.huntEnabled = stateObject.huntEnabled;" on v 1.6.3)
- Android application:
  * App lifeciclye
  * Load games page: Show info about saved games
  * Load games page: Remove ".json" extension
  * Save game: Do not be so restrictive with file names characters
  * Replace toastr by Android toasts ???
  * Remove animations from modal dialogs (only for Android, performance...)
- Save games is not working on Safari
- Toasts with images: align text when the text is multiline
- Combats should be sequential: First finish the first one, then the second, etc
- If the hunting is disabled on the current section, show it on some place (Action Chart?)
- Document all rules
- Common performance (Android and web):
  * Rendering performance on book 2 / sect equimpnt
- Test all books / all sections rendering. It should be valid HTML5
  (https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html)
- Test tags <ch.* /> replacements
- Find "TODO" and do it
- New game page: 
  * Do not show the license text on Android (the book was already downloaded)
  * Ask for the random table type
- If a object description is too long, do not show the entire description: Show the first characters, and add a link
  to display the entire description (see pouchadgana object, and sommerswerd?)
- Action chart buttons don't work on iPad Safari
- Add night mode (brffff...)
- Dialogs with text input: Allow to confirm with the screen keyboard ("go" button)
- Remove the "Alert" text from the message dialog (same for confirms)
- Objects on the Action Chart should have a "available uses count". See "larnumaliqueur" object, book 8, sect228; see "vialbluepills2" object
- Google Play will require API 26 on november 2018 (upgrade Cordova version?)
- Allow to change the font size
