- Objects table: If the quiver has no arrows, show "(0 arrows)"
- Saved games deletion: Do not refresh the entire table (ugly)
- Implement the Kai Monastery "safekeeping" mentioned on the "Equipment" sections
- Books n >= 8: Max number of special objects is 12
- Check reported bugs on Google play:
  * Should be the healing kai discipline be enabled on magnakai books?
  * Saved games removed when adding new games
  * Objects types
  * Others?
- Add the section "Lore-circles of the Magnakai" to the game rules view
- jshint should be runned over non TS generated code

- Allow to select the current bow
- Allow to export / import saved games to the SD card
- Describe:
  * Where play on the web
  * Where Report bugs
  * FAQ
- ERROR: Hunting STILL activated on book 3... 
  (maybe fixed: BookSectionStates.fromStateObject, added line "this.huntEnabled = stateObject.huntEnabled;" on v 1.6.3)
- Android application:
  * App lifeciclye
  * Load games page: Show info about saved games
  * Load games page: Remove ".json" extension
  * Replace toastr by Android toasts ???
  * Remove animations from modal dialogs (only for Android, performance...)
- Save games is not working on Safari
- Toasts with images: align text when the text is multiline
- Combats should be sequential: First finish the first one, then the second, etc
- If the hunting is disabled on the current section, show it on some place (Action Chart?)
- Document all rules
- Common performance (Android and web):
  * Rendering performance on book 2 / sect equimpnt
- Test all books / all sections rendering. It should be valid HTML5
  (https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html)
- Test tags <ch.* /> replacements
- Find "TODO" and do it
- Shared images on multiples books:
  * Allow to declare images on multiple books
  * Choose the latest available image
- New game page: 
  * Do not show the license text on Android (the book was already downloaded)
  * Ask for the random table type
- Use latest version on PAON data on SVN (a fixed commit number)
- Allow to read the "Lore-circles of the Magnakai" section from the "Magnakai Disciplines" section (with a dialog?)
- If a object description is too long, do not show the entire description: Show the first characters, and add a link
  to display the entire description (see pouchadgana object, and sommerswerd?)
