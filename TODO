    sections of book 6 that specifically mention it, and not at all 'rolls' as it is supposed to.
- Performance
- Quivers with no arrows available on section should not show "(0 arrows)". Show "(0 arrows)" only on Action chart. Same to sell quiver

  * 6, sect98: "4 Flechas for 1 Corona" should be "4 Flechas por 1 Corona"
  * 11, equipmnt: Problems with foot notes: 1 should refer to lantern, English version has 3
  * 11, sect76, sect151, sect193: "any missile bonuses", Spanish says "por destreza con armas puedas poseer"
  * 11, sect79: "Pantalla Psíquica" should be "Acometida Psíquica" (see sect81, it's ok there)
  * 11, sect100: Miss quote tag (spanish)
- FAQ: Questions about "I cannot write on the Action Chart"
- "Okay okay. Didn't know about the lone wolf series and went through the 10 programmed books in 2 days. Turns out the rest are online !!! 
   So it won't be as fast to play but I'm definitely continuing. One remark. I'd like to be able to know what was in the Kai monastery at 
   the end so I can continue with that too !"

- Document all rules

- Add night mode (brffff...)
- Dialogs with text input: Allow to confirm with the screen keyboard ("go" button)
- Remove the "Alert" text from the message dialog (same for confirms)

  ("Sommerswerd stuff", repeated rules)
- "Restart book" (at Settings / book death): Add the book number you will restart (ex. "Restart book 9"). On confirmation, explain
  you will restart with your previous book Action Chart status
- PAON English reports:
  "General - You are erroneously allowed to apply multiple Alether effects per combat. You are always limited to one (the berries you can purchase in book 6 even explicitly say so)."
  "Suggestion - An extension of the above, consider saving a snapshot of the action chart when starting a book in section 1. Then add that option to restart the book at section 1 if you die. That way, you don't have to go through and re-do Disciplines and equipment. Keep the option to completely restart the book, though, in case you want to pick different Disciplines or equipment options  "General - You are erroneously allowed to use healing items (Laumspur, etc.) in combat sections before combat has started. Healing items are only to be used in combat sections after combat is over (and if you're still alive and not evading combat)."
  "Add a "random discipline" button that will randomly select the proper number of initial disciplines, as well as your bonus discipline each book from the choices remaining"
  "You are erroneously allowed to use healing items (Laumspur, etc.) in combat sections before combat has started. Healing items are only to be used in combat sections after combat is over (and if you're still alive and not evading combat)."
  "Add a Seventh-Sense-like achievement system"
- Allow to add a concept description for combat skill modifiers rules on combat ratio explanation
- Display concepts for objects usages (Adgana, etc) on combat ratio explanation
- Display book 11 map ("Northern magnamund") somewhere?
- Change all pending javascript files to typescript
