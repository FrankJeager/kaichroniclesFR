- Common performance (Android and web):
  * Minify and join javascript files
  * Rendering performance on book 2 / sect equimpnt
- ERROR: Hunting STILL activated on book 3...
- RE-TEST the random table
- If the book load fails, it doest not try to reload the next time
- Test all books / all sections rendering. It should be valid HTML5
  (https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html)
- Test tags <ch.* /> replacements
- Test controller: Test rules
- Find "TODO" and do it
- Android application:
  * App lifeciclye
  * Load games page: Show info about saved games
  * Load games page: Remove ".json" extension
  * Replace toastr by Android toasts ???
  * Remove animations from modal dialogs (only for Android, performance...)
- Money handling: 
  * Allow to drop an arbitrary amount of money, not just a single coin
  * Support for money as object on section
  * Allow to pick droped money
- Document all rules
- Toasts: If you click on some toast, hide them all
- Save games is not working on safari
- Create a booksSumary.xml, with info about the available books. 
- Combats should be sequential: First finish the first one, then the second, etc
- If you pick an object on the current section: 
  * The rules conditioned by "hasObject" (or "meal" rules) should be re-executed
  * Update combats combat ratio UI
- Toasts with images: align text when the text is multiline
- About the book: 
  * Add the title section info (authors info, and more)
- Save the scroll position on the current section when you change of page
- If the hunting is disabled on the current section, show it on some place (Action Chart?)
- Implement phisical random tables (pick on the screen) ???
- Use project aon colors ???
