        This web application does not send or store any personal information, but it uses
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a> to know how many people use
        the application, and this stores cookies on your web browser.

    </ul>
    <p>
        On the Google Analytics console we cannot see anything about some person. We can see statistics: How many people use the application,
        from where (city / country), mean time played, how many times a book was player, etc.
